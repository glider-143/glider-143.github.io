        <p>It is exciting that today we have started to design our car and print out some of the small components.

I am now thinking of sending our models to on-line 3-D printing shops, which have industrial grade printers and stronger, lighter materials compared with our PLA (I’ve broken the stick shown in the picture already, sad).

        <p>I’ve been learning C, the programming language, for a month since the start of summer holiday. In fact I had  already known a little bit about this language from the book <em>C Primer Plus</em> last summer, however I didn’t finish the book and I’ve forgotten some, so basically I am now learning instead of doing revision. I’ve finished quite a few toy problems and I found some of them interesting which, I think, should be posted here as a record. Also, some of the functions might be used in the future when I start to work on my Arduino (I think most of them have been defined already though) This blog will be updated later.</p>

        <p>Several months ago I locked the frequency of my R7 3700X at 4.1 GHz without changing the voltage. Everything was fine until the weather got hotter now. Yesterday after leaving it running for folding@home for hours  with the AC in my room off, temperature of the CPU reached 95℃ and my computer shut down automatically. Luckily nothing was broken but I don’t think such accidents are good for its life.</p>
<p>Later when I was trying to reduce its frequency in BIOS I noticed something interesting named Precision Boost Overdrive, which was, according to instructions in my BIOS, a “powerful new feature designed to improve multi-threaded performance” by AMD. Initially I thought it was just another automatic overclocking program but in fact there was a little difference here. The standard frequency was still 3.6 GHz (3.59 GHz according to Windows), but the TDP, TDC and EDC limits were unlocked (still limited by the motherboard, of course) which meant the boost frequency could be maintained longer and higher, especially when few cores were working. The Ryzen Master software showed the maximum boost frequency for single core was increased to 4.6 GHz (I really doubt whether it could really reach that high, though.) .</p>
<p>What’s more, since it was altering the boost frequency, it would not get overheated so easily any more. When I ran folding@home and all 8 cores were processing, the frequency was maintained at 4.05 GHz, which was much lower than that of single-core processing and reduced a lot of heat and kept the computer safe. </p>

        <p>Two weeks after it was in the can, our promotional movie is now finally ready to go. Honestly, I am not quite satisfied with it. First, unlike the previous video which was edited by one of my classmates, this one did not require any creativity. I just put all the footages that I shot together, adding subtitles, audio tracks and a background music. It was boring and time consuming, you can see how many pieces there was in the project file. On the other hand, our last video was more like an advertisement with fancy transitions, upgrades, after effects and more aerials (in fact, the aerial scenes in this video were ‘borrowed’ from that one.), which, I think, would be more interesting while editing it.</p>
<p>Moreover, our teacher, also the director of this video, did not communicate properly with the students who appeared on camera. Most of them could not even remember the words to say clearly and sometimes made ambiguous statements, which greatly affected the results of this video.</p>
<p>Anyway, now my work is done, and it did bring me some sense of achievement. I wish that I could have a more interesting task next time.</p>

        <p>I really wanted try  Chains of Olympus once more after finishing the new God of War (it was awesome! ) on PS4. However, my PSP has been broken for years, it couldn’t be recharged via the  charging port, back-light of the screen still worked, but  no colors were shown. One of the speakers had a little noise, buttons were dirty, battery compartment couldn’t be closed properly as the joint was broken.  In a word, it was a mess.</p>
<p>Luckily I could recharge it using the mini USB port and turn it on and I saw that the memory stick could  be read which made me think that probably I could fix it. It took me several days to get the tools and parts to replace online and today I started to work on it.</p>
<p>Thank god that SONY did not use binder to assemble it, which made my job much easier than I expected.  After unscrewing all the screws, I successfully removed the panel and I could get to all the parts that needed to be replaced. The screen was not very easy to be removed<img src="/2020/06/08/Got-my-PSP-fixed/IMG_2496.JPG" alt="Parts that I replaced"></p>
<p>And I made it! It was really touching for me to see this menu again after these years. Sadly I do not have any games to play on it now, which were thrown away a long time ago (Yes, including Chains of Olympus :( )), I think. Anyway, it is not hard to get the discs of games on line and they are really cheap after these years and I am glad that I can see this little thing on again.</p>

        <p>After failing to call all the cores of our CPUs to run the process, my  teammates and I found another way to increase our speed of training. In the past we were using Tensorflow for CPU, which was easy to install, however there is another version which is speceifically designed for Nvidia GPUs. It was really hard to install the GPU version, we needed to install CUDA, cuDNN, and  reinstall an older Python 3.6. One of our teammate gave it up in the end , another one and I made it after retrying several times as the versions of CUDA and cuDNN matters A LOT. Anyway, now our computers could use GPUs to process the images. My RTX2070Super finished the task in 50 minutes, which was more than ten times shorter than the time taken by CPU. This will definitely help us a lot in the competition as we can train our model more times than the other teams.</p>

        <p>In the past several weeks I was participating in a challenge to train a model for automated garbage classification. Together with two of my classmates, I used inception_v3 to process the images. We had a training set which contains 10,000 pictures which required us to run the program for more than 10 hours each time. Initially I thought that it was because of the huge number of  image, or maybe the performance of my PC is just not good enough. However, later I noticed  that while running the program the CPU fan seemed to be working slowly which means the CPU load is low. After checking Ryzen Master I realized  that only two of the eight cores of my CPU is participating. I discussed this problem with my teammates and we spent several days trying to edit the model in order to let it use all the threads of our CPUs until we found out that this has been a problem that is way too hard for us to solve. Even some games which were developed by hundreds of professional programmers, perform poorly in using multiple threads. Wish that someday we would be able to make it.</p>

        <p>几个月来一直在参与海华AI挑战赛的培训。这周也终于圆满完成了比赛，虽然我们的团队差0.04分没能进入前三名，但我们也都有很多收获。</p>
<p>一开始上课的时候遇到了很多困难，虽说是面向中学生的AI入门，课程还是涉及到了很多没有接触过的数学知识。课后和组员讨论，额外找了一些网络上的学习资料，几周以后慢慢能理解线性回归、梯度下降之类的理论，也能自己利用开源的模型进行一些训练了。</p>
<p>后期的课程在教安装TensorFlow时提到了CPU和GPU的特性，刚学完时对GPU在图像处理上的优势还没有什么直观的概念。后来比赛时使用CPU版本的TensorFlow运行训练集，10000张耗费的时间超过了十个小时，才尝试改用GPU进行处理。 GPU版本的TensorFlow安装相当复杂，CUDA、 cuDNN两个软件要安装，而且版本要求严苛，第一次安装时cuDNN使用了10.0版本，最后没能运行。第二次安装成功，但运行模型时还是遇到了错误，求助同组的同学后，我降级了电脑使用的Numpy，才正常运行起来。虽然安装过程遇到了许多困难，最后的成果还是令人满意的，GPU运行同样的任务只花了不到一个小时，一天内模型可以迭代多次，这为我们组的分数做出了很大的贡献。删除了数据增强的部分以后，准确率能够达到99.9%以上。但训练六次后，准确率就不再提高了，甚至下降到了98%。我尝试使用另一个预训练的模型，但是没能成功导入，成绩最后也止步于第四名。</p>
<p>虽然没能够获得理想的成绩，但是参与比赛的过程还是收获了很多知识，对我来说是一个十分宝贵的经历。</p>

        <p>About four years ago, my mobile phone broke down. I spent months trying to fix it. At the beginning, I firmly believed that I could manage to bring it back to life but finally I realized that I couldn’t, and I had to buy another one. It was dispiriting, as I thought that it could be used for at least one more year.</p>
<p>In fact, the malfunction of my phone was totally my fault. It was a Samsung Galaxy Note II which uses the Android 4.4.1 system. It was an old  version which had miserably few functions and features, compared with the Android 6.0. One day when I was browsing an online-community for Samsung users, I noticed a post explaining how to install up-to-date systems for old devices. Over the next few days, I followed the steps and successfully installed a new system for my phone and I was pleased about it for several weeks.Then <del>~ ~</del>one night after reloading its battery, I noticed that I could no longer connect to the cellular network. I couldn’t call anyone or surf the Internet. I immediately panicked as nowadays it’s quite inconvenient to live without a smartphone. Even worse, my parents would have been angry with me, if they knew what I had done.</p>
<p>I began to try to fix it, I told myself that it wouldn’t be difficult, and I thought that the only thing I needed to do was to install the old system. However, it didn’t work. I tried several different system packs made by Samsung and sought advice from some some phone experts  and wished that these packs would help but they didn’t. I gave up and went to the phone shop and asked for post-sales service. They helped me solve the problem, but it didn’t even last a week. I searched the Internet for a solution and I ‘figured out’ that it must be a  problem with the word stock. Just like the systems I installed a word stock through a micro-SD card. Unexpectedly, my phone completely broke down. I couldn’t even turn it on again. I felt awful and gave up trying.. Several days later, I bought a brand-new phone with a preloaded Android 6.0 system. I should had been delighted , but I wasn’t. I really wished that I could make my original Galaxy work once again.</p>
<p>This is the biggest failure I’ve ever experienced; I think. Now, even though I don’t need an 8-year-old phone, I still look for ways to fix it from time to time. I hope that someday I will be skillful enough to bring it back to life. Also, after this, I never did anything which is high-stakes and I’m not sure whether I can handle or not. I think it taught me an important lesson.</p>
