        <p>About four years ago, my mobile phone broke down. I spent months trying to fix it. At the beginning, I firmly believed that I could manage to bring it back to life but finally I realized that I couldn’t, and I had to buy another one. It was dispiriting, as I thought that it could be used for at least one more year.</p>
<p>In fact, the malfunction of my phone was totally my fault. It was a Samsung Galaxy Note II which uses the Android 4.4.1 system. It was an old  version which had miserably few functions and features, compared with the Android 6.0. One day when I was browsing an online-community for Samsung users, I noticed a post explaining how to install up-to-date systems for old devices. Over the next few days, I followed the steps and successfully installed a new system for my phone and I was pleased about it for several weeks.Then <del>~ ~</del>one night after reloading its battery, I noticed that I could no longer connect to the cellular network. I couldn’t call anyone or surf the Internet. I immediately panicked as nowadays it’s quite inconvenient to live without a smartphone. Even worse, my parents would have been angry with me, if they knew what I had done.</p>
<p>I began to try to fix it, I told myself that it wouldn’t be difficult, and I thought that the only thing I needed to do was to install the old system. However, it didn’t work. I tried several different system packs made by Samsung and sought advice from some some phone experts  and wished that these packs would help but they didn’t. I gave up and went to the phone shop and asked for post-sales service. They helped me solve the problem, but it didn’t even last a week. I searched the Internet for a solution and I ‘figured out’ that it must be a  problem with the word stock. Just like the systems I installed a word stock through a micro-SD card. Unexpectedly, my phone completely broke down. I couldn’t even turn it on again. I felt awful and gave up trying.. Several days later, I bought a brand-new phone with a preloaded Android 6.0 system. I should had been delighted , but I wasn’t. I really wished that I could make my original Galaxy work once again.</p>
<p>This is the biggest failure I’ve ever experienced; I think. Now, even though I don’t need an 8-year-old phone, I still look for ways to fix it from time to time. I hope that someday I will be skillful enough to bring it back to life. Also, after this, I never did anything which is high-stakes and I’m not sure whether I can handle or not. I think it taught me an important lesson.</p>
